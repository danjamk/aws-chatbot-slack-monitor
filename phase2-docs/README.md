# AWS Alert Intelligence System - Design Documentation

**Status:** üü° Design Phase - Iteration in Progress
**Version:** 0.1.0
**Last Updated:** 2025-10-21

## What Is This?

This folder contains comprehensive design documentation for **rebuilding the AWS monitoring system with AI-powered analysis**.

**The Problem:** AWS Chatbot is limiting our capabilities - it filters messages, reformats output, provides no AI analysis, and costs $19/month for basic natural language features.

**The Solution:** Build our own LangGraph-powered system that analyzes AWS alerts with Claude AI, provides actionable diagnostics, and supports interactive investigation via Slack - all for ~$3-10/month.

## Quick Decision Summary

### Confirmed Decisions ‚úÖ

1. **Start with AWS tools only** (defer git integration)
2. **11 core tools for Phase 1:**
   - Cost: get_cost_breakdown, get_service_costs, get_budget_status, get_cost_forecast
   - Compute: get_lambda_metrics, get_lambda_errors, get_ec2_instances
   - Logging: get_cloudwatch_logs, search_logs
   - Infrastructure: get_resource_tags, get_recent_changes

3. **DynamoDB On-Demand for conversation storage** (Phase 2)
   - Cost: ~$0.01/month (negligible)
   - Fast, simple, serverless

4. **Cost-optimized architecture:**
   - Only analyze critical alerts (‚â•80% budget, ERROR alarms)
   - Skip daily reports (no LLM cost)
   - Expected: $1.42/month (Phase 1), $5-10/month (Phase 2)

### Open Questions ‚ùì

- Which specific CloudWatch alarms to analyze?
- Should we keep AWS Chatbot during transition (hybrid approach)?
- Custom alert patterns to support?
- Detailed Slack message format preferences?

---

## Key Insights from Design

### 1. Cost is NOT a Concern

**Storage:** DynamoDB costs < $0.10/month even at 10x expected scale
**Biggest cost:** Claude API (~70% of total), still only $5-10/month
**Comparison:** 60-85% cheaper than Amazon Q Developer

**Decision:** Don't over-optimize storage. Use DynamoDB for simplicity.

### 2. LLM Analysis is the Real Value

**Without AI:**
- Generic alert: "Budget exceeded"
- User investigates manually: 30-60 minutes

**With AI:**
- Root cause analysis
- Specific diagnostic commands
- Remediation suggestions
- Investigation time: < 2 minutes

**Value:** 15-30x faster issue resolution

### 3. Code/Repo Integration is Game-Changing

**Original idea:** Basic AWS tools
**Your insight:** Analyze git repos and Lambda code

**Impact:**
- Correlate code changes with cost spikes
- Identify buggy commits automatically
- Provide specific code fixes

**Priority:** Phase 3 (after Phase 1/2 working)

### 4. Modular Tool Architecture Enables Growth

**Phase 1:** 11 AWS tools
**Phase 2:** Add conversation tools
**Phase 3:** Add git/code tools
**Phase 4:** Add security tools (Security Hub, GuardDuty)

**Each addition is independent** - no need to redesign core system

## What's Different from Current System?

| Feature | AWS Chatbot (Current) | AI Alert Intelligence (Proposed) |
|---------|----------------------|-----------------------------------|
| **Message Filtering** | Filters out plain SNS | Accepts all event types |
| **Formatting** | Rigid CloudWatch format | Custom, beautiful Slack blocks |
| **AI Analysis** | None | Claude-powered diagnostics |
| **Diagnostic Suggestions** | None | Auto-generated AWS CLI commands |
| **Interactive Queries** | Basic CLI only ($19/month extra) | Natural language (Phase 2) |
| **Cost** | $0 (basic) or $19/month (Q) | $3-10/month (all features) |
| **Customization** | Limited | Full control |
| **Root Cause Analysis** | None | Automated |
| **Code Integration** | No | Yes (future) |

## Questions for Discussion

**Before we proceed with implementation:**

1. **Alert Routing:**
   - Is critical/heartbeat channel split correct?
   - What specific thresholds should trigger AI analysis?

2. **Tool Priority:**
   - Which 5-6 tools should we build first?
   - Any critical tools missing from the list?

3. **LLM Provider:**
   - AWS Bedrock (integrated) vs. Direct Anthropic API?
   - Claude 3.5 Sonnet vs. Haiku for simple queries?

4. **Migration Strategy:**
   - Keep AWS Chatbot during transition (hybrid)?
   - Or full replacement from day 1?

5. **Success Metrics:**
   - What defines "good enough" AI analysis?
   - How to measure time saved vs. manual investigation?

6. **Future Features:**
   - Priority order for Phase 2/3 features?
   - Git integration: must-have or nice-to-have?
