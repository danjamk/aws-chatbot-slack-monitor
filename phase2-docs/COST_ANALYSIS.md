- Average 30 seconds execution time per alert
- Average 2,000 input tokens + 1,000 output tokens per analysis

### Cost by Component

#### 1. AWS Lambda

**Invocations:**
```
10 alerts/month Ã— $0.20 per 1M requests = $0.000002
```
**FREE TIER:** First 1M requests/month free âœ…

**Duration:**
```
Compute:
- 10 invocations Ã— 30 seconds
- Memory: 512MB = 0.5GB
- GB-seconds: 10 Ã— 30 Ã— 0.5 = 150 GB-seconds

Cost:
- $0.0000166667 per GB-second
- 150 Ã— $0.0000166667 = $0.0025

Monthly: $0.003
Rounded: $0.01/month
```

**FREE TIER:** First 400,000 GB-seconds/month free âœ…
*We use ~150 GB-seconds, well within free tier*

**Lambda Total: $0.00/month** (free tier covers us)

---

#### 2. Claude 3.5 Sonnet (AWS Bedrock)

**Pricing (as of 2025):**
- Input: $0.003 per 1K tokens
- Output: $0.015 per 1K tokens

**Per Alert:**
```
Input: 2,000 tokens Ã— $0.003 / 1000 = $0.006
Output: 1,000 tokens Ã— $0.015 / 1000 = $0.015
Total per alert: $0.021
```

**Monthly (10 alerts):**
```
10 Ã— $0.021 = $0.21/month
```

**BUT WAIT** - We use better prompt engineering:

**Optimized Token Usage:**
- Input: ~1,500 tokens (compressed context)
- Output: ~800 tokens (structured JSON)

**Recalculated:**
```
Input: 1,500 Ã— $0.003 / 1000 = $0.0045
Output: 800 Ã— $0.015 / 1000 = $0.012
Total per alert: $0.0165

Monthly: 10 Ã— $0.0165 = $0.165
Rounded: $0.17/month
```

**But we're conservative, budget for:** **$0.60/month**

*Note: Actual may be lower with optimization*

**Storage:**
```
Total data: 500 messages Ã— 2KB = 1MB = 0.001 GB
Storage cost: 0.001 Ã— $0.25/GB = $0.00025/month

Rounded: < $0.01/month
```

**Read Operations:**
```
Per conversation:
- Load history: 1 read
- During conversation: 2 reads (load + verify)
- Total per conversation: 3 reads

Monthly: 50 conversations Ã— 3 = 150 reads

Cost: 150 / 1,000,000 Ã— $0.25 = $0.0000375
Rounded: < $0.01/month
```

**Write Operations:**
```
Per conversation:
- Create: 1 write
- Messages: 10 writes
- Total per conversation: 11 writes

Monthly: 50 conversations Ã— 11 = 550 writes

Cost: 550 / 1,000,000 Ã— $1.25 = $0.0006875
Rounded: < $0.01/month
```

**DynamoDB Total: $0.01/month** âœ…

*Even at 10x scale (500 conversations): $0.10/month*

Lifecycle to Glacier after 30 days: negligible

Rounded: < $0.01/month
```

**Requests:**
```
PUT: 50 conversations Ã— $0.005/1000 = $0.00025
GET: ~10 archive retrievals Ã— $0.0004/1000 = $0.000004

Total: < $0.01/month
```

**S3 Total: $0.01/month** (if using archival)

#### 5. Additional Claude API Calls

**Interactive queries are cheaper (less context needed):**

**Per interaction:**
```
Input: ~1,000 tokens (user question + recent history)
Output: ~600 tokens (answer)

Input: 1,000 Ã— $0.003 / 1000 = $0.003
Output: 600 Ã— $0.015 / 1000 = $0.009
Total: $0.012 per interaction
```

**Monthly (50 interactions):**
```

## Cost Optimization Strategies

### 1. Reduce LLM Calls

**Current:** Analyze every critical alert

**Optimization:** Only analyze severe alerts
```
Before: 50 alerts/month Ã— $0.06 = $3.00
After: 25 alerts/month Ã— $0.06 = $1.50
Savings: $1.50/month (50%)
```

### 2. Compress Context

**Current:** ~1,500 input tokens per analysis

**Optimization:** Compress AWS context, use embeddings
```
Before: 1,500 tokens input
After: 1,000 tokens input
Savings: 33% reduction = $0.20/month at 50 alerts
```

### 3. Cache Tool Results

**Optimization:** Cache Cost Explorer results for 5 minutes
```
Savings: ~50% reduction in API calls = $0.05-0.25/month
```

### 4. Use Claude Haiku for Simple Queries

**Phase 2 optimization:**

**Haiku pricing:**
- Input: $0.00025/1K tokens (12x cheaper)
- Output: $0.00125/1K tokens (12x cheaper)

**Savings for simple queries:**
```
Before (Sonnet): $0.012 per interaction
After (Haiku): $0.001 per interaction
Savings: $0.011 per interaction

If 50% of queries use Haiku:
Monthly savings: 25 Ã— $0.011 = $0.28/month
```

### 5. Reduce Conversation Storage

**Current:** 7-day TTL

**Optimization:** 3-day TTL
```
Negligible storage savings (~50%), but good practice
```
